# Code-Along: Speaking Grandma



## Objectives

In this lab you will create an `if`/`else` statement, comparing strings, and creating a `Bool` variable to pass into a conditional.


## Instructions

1. Write a function named `speaking to grandma`. It will take in a string and return a string.
2. If grandma is shouting (the argument is all caps) return "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!".
3. Else if grandma is not shouting (the argument is all lower case) return "WHAT'S THAT? SPEAK UP, DEAR!".
4. Test your function by calling it and passing in the following arguments:

```
let phraseOne = "hi, grandma!"
//Should return "WHAT'S THAT? SPEAK UP, DEAR!"

let phraseTwo = "HI, GRANDMA!"
//Should return "NO, NOT SINCE 1938!"

let phraseThree = "HeLlO GrAnDmA!"
//what does this print out, how can you handle this situation?
```
